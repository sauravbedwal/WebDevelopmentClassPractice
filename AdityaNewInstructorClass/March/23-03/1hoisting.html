During Memory Execution Phase we scan to the entire file as it will not run anything and reserves some memory space for
every single variable including funcitons as every single variable and function will be added to the Memory Component as
it will reserve some space for every variable and funciton and while reserving the space the default value given to
variables is undefiend AND default value given to function is function body and that is called Hoisting.

The mechanism of reserving space for variables and functions during the Memory Creation Phase is called Hoisting. -->
