<!-- Second Rule: Explicit Binding to find out what is the this keyword with in a function -->
<!-- 2. Explicit Binding -->
<!-- when we tell Expliciticly tell the this keyword what it should be binded to. as when we call the function we want to tell it that uh dont decide i will tell uh which object uh should binded to.      -->

<!-- <script>
    function greet() {
        console.log("hello!");
    }

    // greet();         //behind the scenes, there is a method called as .call on every function which actually is used to envoked the function. as function act like any other objects which means that they can be passed to a variable, they can be passed to a function as an argument, the can be return from a funciton as well. which means just like objects have methods of them, every function also has a few methods of them and one of them is CALL METHOD.
    greet.call();       //js converts greet() to greet.call(); behind the scenes as by bith we get the same result  
</script> -->



<!-- same code as above here we just passed an argument -->
<!-- <script>
    function greet(name) {
        console.log("hello!", name);
    }

    greet("shinchan");                         //passing argument here is possible and we will get the result
    // greet.call("shinchan");                //but here passing argument is not correct as it will print undefined
</script>  -->




<!-- in this code we want to call the function greet() and want that the this keyword which is within the fucntion point to user object -->
<!-- <script>
    function greet() {                     //this keyword is used to reuse the function with differnet object as we calling the greet() in whcih we want it to point out to user object.  
        console.log("hello!", this);       //this keyword here is pointing to user object as we passer user object while calling the function.
        console.log("Name", this.name);      //we can do this bcoz this is user and we have learenedd we can do user.name so same we doing by this.name

    // greet();                         //as greet() and greet.call() both are same but we cant assign the this keyword a value but for doing that we can use the .call method we can pass anything as argument and that will become the value of the this keyword 
    greet.call(user);                 //as .call method is exist on every function and the first argument we give to .call method is the this keyword and it can be anything like an object, array, number , string but mostly we see object as its not mandatory measns we calling the greet function and passing the user object as the this keyword value
</script> -->




<!--  in this code we learned if function have parameters then how it works and also another ex of above code as we want to call the function greet() and want that the this keyword which is within the fucntion point to parent object -->
<!-- <script>

        console.log("Name", this.name);
        console.log("Age", this.age);

        name: "Christle",
        age: 55
    };

    greet.call(user, 'Hyderabad', 'India');      //as first argument will always be point to this keyword and after the first argument whatevr we add here will be value of city and same if we have 2 parameters like city and country then after 2 second argument whatevr we add here will be value of country
    greet.call(parent, 'Delhi');                //and to know what the this keyword is we have to always check where the function was envoked as here we know we calling greet function and passing parent means this keyword is pointing to parent object.

<!-- we have an array args and we want to pass the elements of array in .call method/greet.call funciton and also .apply method for smae purpose in case browser dont support new featurs -->

    // greet.call(user, ...args);              //this is the smae thhing like above line as if we sure that the code we writing will not be used in very old broswers then use .call but if we want to support very very old browser then use .apply but if we have only one argument to pass then always use .call only and if more than one with in an array then use .apply.
