<!-- sir revised it and gave the example of using spread and rest opeartor together -->
<script>
    function sum(...rest) {         //below in result3 we spread the items in sum() and here we collecting all the items usimg ...rest opeartor in an array named rest   
        console.log(rest);
    }
    const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];

    const result3 = sum(...numbers);    //want to pass all these elements individually of numbers array in sum() so we can use spread operator i.e ...numbers means we spreading out this numbers array in sum()
    console.log(result3);
