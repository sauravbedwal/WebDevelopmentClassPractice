//this is abt app.jsx as we understanding that how we can return the function in differnet ways by using ()
//as () is to format the code as it doesnt add anything and same we did in app.jsx file in retrun we added ()

//we can return like these ways and thats the same thing in all three ways.
function sum() {
    // return 2;
    // return (2);
    return (
        2
    );
}

sum();

function add() {
    return 
        2;              //if we do like this then it wont return anything bcoz 2 is in next line and after return 
                    //there is empty sopace so it will take it as we r not retruning anythng means undefined and will return undefined as continuity is mandatory
