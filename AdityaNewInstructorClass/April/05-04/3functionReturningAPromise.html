<!-- /* ---------------------- Function returning a Promise ---------------------- */ -->

<!-- in this code learned how to return promise from function -->
<script>
    function getAPromise() {
        const promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) =>{
            resolve("Hello");
        });

        return promise;
    }

    getAPromise().then((data) =>{   //this data will be hello as return promise above will be returned that to getpromise and as it returned the promise we used .then() which will be hello.
        console.log(data);  
    })

</script>



<!-- same code as above but we can simply retrun the promise at the beginning also instead of returning it later as it is little shorter-->
<script>
    function getAPromise() {
        return new Promise((resolve, reject) =>{
            resolve("Hello");
        });
    }

    getAPromise().then((data) =>{ 
        console.log(data);  
    })

</script>



<!-- same code as above but by arrow fuction then it will be more short and final by sir -->
<script>
    const getAPromise = () =>
        // new Promise((resolve, reject) =>{  //as we r not using reject argument in this case then we can aslo remove it.
        new promise((resolve) =>{   
            resolve("Hello");
        });
    

    getAPromise().then((data) =>{ 
        console.log(data);
