in the way of aditya keri wihtout return keyword and {} as there is only one statment so we can do that with

<!-- <script>
    fetch("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1").then((response) =>{
      return response.json();
    })
    .then((data) => {
        console.log(data);
    });
</script> -->

<script>
    fetch("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1")
    .then((response) => response.json())                    //didnt wrote retrun as it is single statement 
    .then((data) => console.log(data));
