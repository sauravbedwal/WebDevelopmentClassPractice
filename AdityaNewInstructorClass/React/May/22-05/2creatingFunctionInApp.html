<!-- here if we call App() first it will follow the code line by line and create getInitialState funciton call it 
and console it but when we call it again then again it follow the code line by line and create getInitialState
function again whihc is not needed here -->

<!-- <script>
    function App() {
        function getInitialState() {
            return 2;
        }

        const result = getInitialState();
        console.log(`Result is ${result}`);
    }

    App();
</script> -->


<!-- This is the better approach as we created te getInitialState function outside of App() so now it wont create
again and again. -->
<script> 
    function getInitialState(number) {
        // return 2;    
            return number;
        };

    function App() {
        const result = getInitialState(197);
        console.log(`Result is ${result}`);
    };

    App();
</script>
