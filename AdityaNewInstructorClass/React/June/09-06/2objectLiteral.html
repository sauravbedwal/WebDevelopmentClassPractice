<!-- this js example is related to memo as in <OptimizedChild /> if we passing same props then it won't re-render
again but if we passing an object with id: 1 then it will re-render again and again bcoz each time it has different 
reference. -->

<!-- <script>
    function greet(user) {
        console.log(user.name);
    }

    greet({ name: "Aditya" });   //object literal as three of them contain the same property and value but all the three of them are diff. values doe to diff. reference.
    greet({ name: "Aditya" });
    greet({ name: "Aditya" });
</script> -->



<!-- here it wont re-render again bcoz this time it is the same object bcoz the reference is the same  -->

<!-- <script>
    function greet(user) {
        console.log(user.name);
    }

    const user_details = {
        name: "Aditya",
    };

    greet(user_details);   //object literal
    greet(user_details);
    greet(user_details);
</script> -->



<script>
    function greet(user) {
        user.name = "Abhishek";
    };

    const user_details = {
        name: "Aditya",
    };

    greet(user_details);
    console.log(user_details.name);
