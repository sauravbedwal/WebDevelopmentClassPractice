<!-- ******************************************** Virtual DOM ******************************************* -->


<!-- let say in App comp. we returning  

<div id="root">Hello World</div>

as when we write html in react comp. browsers don't really undderstand and there is a tool which used to
convert jsx to something that browser can undderstand and the tool is Babel. 
and BTS react will convert that entire jsx into React.createElement() wiht some argument i.e. 1. waht is the 
type of the element, and second is whatever he props we passing to the element, and third one is Children
menas whatever is in b/w the openeing and the closing tag thats the CHildren.   


we can pass the children by two ways:
React.createElement('div', {id: "root"}, 'Hello World')
React.createElement('div', {id: "root", children: 'Hello World'})


as we can return this also in react comp and we will get the same result.
and before jsx was popular people used to write it like that only.

as we can imagine that in react file createElement will be a function which have 3 parameters i.e. elementType, props, and 
...children props.

function createElement(elementType, props, ...children) {
} -->

<!-- 
another example

<span className="active">Newton</span>

React.createElement('span', {className: "active", children: "Newton"}) -->


<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->


<!-- as previously we had only one children but now as we have more than one children i.e. two children in b/w 
<div></div> tag so we can use an array and now if we take first span so it is same as we doing for above text
in b/w a tag so react will convert this to React.createElement and as there is no prop so we used null in
argument 
 
<div>
    <span>Hello</span>
    <span>World</span>
</div>


//<span>Hello</span>
//<span>World</span>

React.createElement('div', {
    children: [
    React.createElement('span', null, 'Hello'),
    React.createElement('span', null, 'World')
    ] 
}) -->


<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->


<!-- <div id="root">Hello World</div>

React.createElement('div', {id: "root"}, 'Hello World')

and as its a function call means react is calling a function so it must return somthing and in this case
funciton will return one object 

and object is something like this not exactly but somthing lik this

/*
React Element :
{
    type: "div",
    key: null,
    ref: null,
    props: { id: "root", children: "Hello World" },
    _owner: null,
    _store: {}
}


Whenever we do console.log we get a very big object as it has so many thing in it and that is what we called
html element and DOM is made up of all of such html elements. 
and React Element is equavivalent to html element as with in the real DOM we have html elements but react uses
something called Virtual DOM and virtual DOM consists of all react elements which is a smaller object compared
to html element as it is much more light weight and that is what Virtual DOM is made up of.

<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->


<!-- 
in the frist render when react will come across a comp like
<div id="root">Hello World</div>

now react will take this and react will construct a Virtual DOM with this as Virtual DOM is similar to real DOM
just that in real DOM it consists of html elements but Virtual DOM here is constructed using React Elements i.e
the object. so react will come across div tag and then convert this into an object and then create a node with
the object and that node will contain the react element object. 

and if div tag contains <span></span> tag inside it or have other components also then it will create Virtual
DOM from all of those nodes where every node is a react element and thats the differnce b/w real and Virtual
DOM.

As, in real DOM every single node consists of html element which is a really big object but Virutal DOM
 consists of react elements bcoz of which the Virtual DOM entirely is much more light weight than real DOM.
 
A Virtual DOM is a light weight representation of the real DOM. 

AND once react construct Virtual DOM with react elements and then react will take the Virtual DOM and added to
the actual DOM.
SO react will take the Virtual DOM and it will construct the real DOM out of the Virtual DOM in the first 
render. -->


<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->


<!-- Whenever there is a re-render let say
<h1>Count: {count}</h1>
<h3>Hello World</h3>
and between both of them h1 tag will change bcoz it has count value. so now react will remember the Virtual DOM
that we had in initial render and react will construct a new Virtual DOM from scractch looking at the new update
so whatever changed in re-render will be formed with rest element will be same and now when react will update the real DOM
it will check that which element is actually changed and in real DOM it will change only that part.   -->


<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->


<!-- ********************************************** Portals ********************************************* -->

<!-- 

with in body we have div with id of root whihc is presnet is index.html file and in body we dont have other
 elements as we have only div and script here and in main.jsx whwatever element  we render ultimately <App />
 will be render isnide div tag in index.html 
 ultimately react will construct the virtual dom looking at this <App /> inmain.jsx file and by going isnide
 <App /> and whatever is inside App will be construct huge virtual DOM and it finally insert everything with in 
 our div tag in index.html file.

 but what if we don't want to render our content inside div tag with id of root as every comp we make with in
 our APP comp come inside the App comp as its the top level comp and app is renderng insid ethe div tag wth id root
 menas every single element will basically be render inside div tag with id of root.
 but what if we want to render something not inside the div we want to create an element after div and we want to 
 render there and that is basically possible using Portals.
 

 LET SAY WE CREATED A new div with id of portal just below the div tag with id of root in index.html file

<div id="root"></div>
<div id="portal"></div>

 so we can create a component and we can basically rend it in this div tag with id of portal. -->
