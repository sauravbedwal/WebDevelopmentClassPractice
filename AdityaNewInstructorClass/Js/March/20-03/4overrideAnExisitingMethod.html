<!-- in this code we learned how to override the existing methods on the arrays -->
<!-- main purpose of protoype object is to store a collection of all the methods which can be reused across multiple
instances.
the prototype of the array i.e. Array.prototype simply contains all the methods which can be used across all the newly
create arrays. -->
<!-- <script>
    const array = [1, 2, 3];

    // override the map method
    Array.prototype.map = function () {
        console.log("Hahahaha, overridden!");
    };

    array.map();                   //map function will no longer work as its overridden and we will get "Hahahaha, overridden!"  
</script> -->



<!-- in interview asked question to create ur own map function whih means using a custom function that we create called myMap so here
we created the inbuilt map function for understadning  -->
<!-- <script>
    const array = [1, 2, 3];

    actual map function
    const newArray = array.map((element) => {
        return element * 2;
    });
    console.log(newArray);
</script> -->




<!-- in this code just explained what if we pass a fucntion as an argument in a function as it is related to crearting own myMap function in next 5no.file -->
<!-- <script>
    function myMap(cb) {                        //thats a regular normal function and cb is parameter which we can sya is callback
        console.log(cb);                          //we will get an arrow function here
    };

    // we can use arrow or nomral function both for understanding
    const callback = () => { };                   //that an arrow function
    // function callback() {};

    myMap(callback);                           //calling myMap function and passing the callback function which means in myMap() will get callback i.e. fucntion myMap(callback). callback function is an arrow function and have a simple myMap function here and we passing the callback arrow function as an argument to myMap() 
</script> -->



<!-- same as above code as here we passed the value also as in the code just explained what if we pass a fucntion as an argument in a function as it is related to crearting own myMap function in next 5no.file-->
<!-- <script>
    function myMap(cb) {
        cb(1);                                     // calling the callback function and passsing an argument of 1 whihc means this 1 will be sent as an argument to callback fucnton 
    };

    // function callback() { };                       //which means this callback() here will receive a paremeter here let say num.
    function callback(num) {
        console.log(num);                             //and here will get 1
    };

    myMap(callback);

    // as we can also understand it that when we passed a function as an argument in the fucntion then in myMap
    // function callback passed as an parameter and inside that function we did cb(1) here cb is callback which came
    // when we passed it in myMap() while calling it and callback is itslef a function so we we do cb(1) actually it is
    // callback(1) and as it is callback(1) means we passing 1 as an argument to the callback function and if we passing
    // an argument then ther must be a pareameter in callback that we get callback(num) and now cb(1) means callback(1)
    // passed in callback(num) and when we console num we get 1
