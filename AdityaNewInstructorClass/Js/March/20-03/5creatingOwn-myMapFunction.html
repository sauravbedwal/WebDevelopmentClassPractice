<!-- in this code we want to loop over this array and for every element here we want to call this cb() function  and here 
myMap is almost ready but its working for only the array that we created but we want this myMap to work for any array for that we check below code -->

<!-- doubt herer it has to be 2, 4 ,6 and then miltipled by 3 at last so 6. 12, 18 as i feel it happend bcox 
earlier we passing callaback function in myMap and now we passing dietctly eleement and aboce i guess its cb(array[i])
i.e. 1(1) then 2(2) but i guess its wrong its not lketbat very confused as it showing 3,6,9 so now so menas its dreiclty

dpoing eleement * 3 but then what abt .map fucntoin as element is passed in ,map then it has to go above and follow map function-->
