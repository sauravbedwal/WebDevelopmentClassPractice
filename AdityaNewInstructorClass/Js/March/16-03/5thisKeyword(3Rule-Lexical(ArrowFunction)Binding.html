<!-- Third Rule: Lexical (arrow function) Binding to find out what is the this keyword with in a function -->
<!-- 3. Lexical (arrow function) Binding -->
<!-- arrow function introduced not bcoz they r very short and simple to use or read as they dont have alot of features that
that a normal functions have means they took a function and removed the access weight and make it lean, premium and slim
bcoz of thta it doesnt have lot of features taht normal function have and one of them is reagrding the this keyword -->
