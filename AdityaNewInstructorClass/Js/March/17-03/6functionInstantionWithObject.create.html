<!-- in this code we used object.create() and took the same code (1st code ) from 4file but this time did the same work by
usig object.create() ehich male code more simpler and easy as earlier work and sleep method in person object were
pointing to the work and sleep of sharedMethods objects and as we creating new objects and all of them pointing to the
same things and then we removed the poreprties except shareMethods object and linked the entier object to the
shareMethods and beneft of this is if tomoworow a new ,ethod adds in sharedMethods let say eat() and now its work, sleep
and eat so there is no need of chanegs to do in code as it added in sharedMethods all the other objects can access that
as they r linked to shareMethods as by previous method we have to add the person.eat = sharedMethods.eat() agaian and again and here we created the linked once as it will work smoothly -->
<script>
    const sharedMethods = {
        work: function () {
            console.log(`${this.name} is working`);
        },

        sleep: function () {
            console.log(`${this.name} is sleeping`);
        },

        eat: function () {
            console.log(`${this.name} is eating`);
        },
    }

    function Person(name, age) {
        const person = Object.create(sharedMethods);
        person.name = name;
        person.age = age;

        return person;
    }


    const personOne = Person("Levi", 28);
    personOne.eat();
