<!-- if we see Person funciton taht is a very common pattern as if we vane common pattern that we do multiple times there is
always a better way to do the same thing like js provde us better way to do same thing and i.e. by using new Keyword 
if we use new keyword no need to use Object.create method and retun person and replace person.name to this.name -->
<!-- Constructor Function - it automatically create a link between this keyword and the prototype and it wll also retun the
this keyword automatically and thats how its work as the new keyword does both the things behind the scenes -->
<script>
    function Person(name, age) {
        // behind the scenes autotomatically due to which we gt the same outpput as last code of 7 file we can compare
        // const this = Object.create(Person.prototype);             //we creating a new object here which ahve alinkn to Person.protoype whihc means if we acccess something which does not exist on this object it will go and lookup taht in Person.prototype  

        this.name = name;
