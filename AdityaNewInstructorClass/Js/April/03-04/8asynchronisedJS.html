JS is Asynchronised language as it does the thing one by one as it is single threaded.
bur bcoz of Event loop we can continue doing things by other things to be done simataneously.

here we will not wait for 50000ms(50 sec) that doesnt make any sense and that why we need web api which can handle these things
whIle js engine will contninue to run the other line of codes. AND THIS possible bcoz of Web Api, the call backk queue and eventLOOP.
 

<script>
    console.log("First");

    setTimeout(()=> {
        console.log("JavaScript");
    }, 50000);

    console.log("Last");
</script>
