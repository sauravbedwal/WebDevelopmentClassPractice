<!-- //Closures
useCaseOfClosures
Encapsulation and Abstraction -->

<!-- all the methods/function have the closure over salaray variable and salary variable is not directly accesible
outside the world. nobody can change the rahulSalary direclty as noone can access the variable as it can only 
be done by the three methods of return and that waht we call is Encapsulation.

abstraction - we are hiding the implementation details from the outside world. Outside world does not know what is the calcualtion happening inside the raise function or lower function. -->
