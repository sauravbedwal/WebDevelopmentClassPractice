In React, when you install a package like Parcel with a caret (^2.8.4) in your `package.json`, it will automatically update to newer minor and patch 
versions that are compatible with version 2.8.4. So, if a newer version like 2.8.8 is released, running `npm install` will update `package-lock.json`
 to this version, reflecting the latest compatible version installed.

Your `package-lock.json` will update to reflect the current version installed, like 2.8.8, while your `package.json` will still show ^2.8.4, 
indicating the version range you've specified. This allows for flexibility in updating to compatible versions.

dist keep the bundle of all html,css and js files into one in devlopment and production (build) both environments. 

**Transitive dependencies** are the dependencies of your direct dependencies. They are automatically installed and can affect your project, 
even though they arenâ€™t explicitly listed in your `package.json`.
