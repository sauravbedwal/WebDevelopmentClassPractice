1. useEffect : - if no dependency array => useEffect is called on every render (component render).
   - if dependency array is empty = [] => useEffect is called on initial/first render(just once).
   - if dependency array is [btnNameReact] => called everytime btnNameReact is updated.

2. useState : - Never use useState/create state variable outside of the component.
   - Always create the useState hook on the top in the component.
   - Never create useState variable inside if else, loop or function. 

3. Never use anchor tag <a></a> for routing bcoz it reloads the page and that we dont want.

4. Single Page Application(SPA) : It doesn't reload the page as it just refresh the components that's why
react Application known as Sinle Page Application. Just Components interchanging themselves.

5. 2 types of Routing in web apps
   - Client Side Routing : Making No network call because all the components are already loading into our
    app. As we have all the Components/pages already, and not fetching any page, just need to load them and
    it used in SPA. 
   
   - Server Side Routing : Have Different html pages like index.html, about.html, contact.html and if click
   on anchor tag /about.html it reloads the whole page as it sends the network call to about.html, fetches
   that html and renders it to the UI/web page. (old way)
   
   Making a network call and the pages coming from Server and it reloads tha page is Server Side Routing. 

6. Dynamic Routing : For dynamic routing pass the new object in children just the difference is /:variable 
here like /:resId.
   - import useParams where we want to access the variable/id passed.
   - by useParams we can read/access the dynamic url as useParams gives us an object with dynamic id that 
   we can destructure and use the id.
   - as in the main page where all cards available when we click any card it will take to that particular
   item page as we using Link there and routing it with dynamic id and now as url have the dynamic id so 
   by useParams we can access/get that id and use it while fetching API.
