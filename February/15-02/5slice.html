<!-- slice(1, 3) starts at index 1 and goes up to, but does not include, index 3. So, it includes elements at indices 1 and
2, which are 55 and 11 respectively.

slice(2, 3) starts at index 2 and goes up to, but does not include, index 3. So, it includes only the element at index
2, which is 11.

slice(3, 3) starts at index 3 and goes up to, but does not include, index 3. Since the start and end indices are the
same, an empty array [] is returned. -->
