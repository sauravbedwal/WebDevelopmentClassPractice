NEED TO LEAR ALSO REGEX PATTERN not in syllabus but salman sir said we can learnit 
doubt

in events when sue event in bracket and when not ? 
ad why he put onsubmit in form tag why not in button tag as in onclick he put that in button and as its a submission so it has to be n button>?
in age he used list.elements[i].value but oin value there will be name also na then its only storing age in wrror age var.
