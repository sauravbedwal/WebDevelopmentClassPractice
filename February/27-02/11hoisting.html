<!-- what is hoisting? -->
<!--when we declare a function and calling a funciton before declarartion is called hoisting. -->

<!-- how hoisting is working? -->
<!--inside the js compiler they r using call stack for all the code as it will first push inside the call stack 
then execution will happen and then it will pops but inside the call stack the first thing going to happen is
Golbal execution context will be created and before executing anh code whatever the variable and function are there will going to declare (registered)
inside the Golbal execution context and from there it will start working. (everything will store here)-->

<script> 
    //this concept is called hoisting concept
    //if we declare the function which is not stored in any vairable and call it before the declaration then 
    //still it will run and show the output
    console.log(addition(3,3));                 //as this stored in Golbal execution context so when run the code compiler will  
    function addition(a,b){                    //understand that addition is already registered so it will find the code(function (additon)) it will execute. 
        return a+b;
    }
    // console.log(addition(3,3));
</script>



<script>
    //if we declare the function which is stored in the vairable and call it before the declaration then 
    //it will not run and show the error.
    
    //console.log(subtraction(3,4));
    const subtraction = (a, b) => {
        return a - b;
    }
