Here's a refined and optimized version of your notes. I've structured them better, clarified concepts, corrected typos, and improved readability without altering the original content too much.

# **Class 3: Node.js Introduction**

### **1. Node.js REPL** 
- REPL stands for **Read, Evaluate, Print, Loop**.
- It's similar to the browser console, but in the terminal.
- Browsers run the **V8 JavaScript Engine**, while Node.js also uses V8 but adds additional features (superpowers).

### **2. Node.js Overview**
- Node.js is a **JavaScript runtime environment**.
- It uses the **V8 JavaScript Engine** to execute JS code.
- When you write JS code, Node.js passes it to the V8 engine, which:
  - Converts it to machine code (since V8 is written in C++).
  - Executes the machine-level code, making it understandable for the computer.

### **3. First Node.js Code**
- To execute a file in Node.js:
  1. Create a file, e.g., `app.js`.
  2. Run it with the command `node app.js` in the terminal.

### **4. Node.js Global Object**
- In browsers, the global object is `window`, and `this` refers to `window`.
- In Node.js, the global object is `global`.
- Functions like `setTimeout`, `setInterval`, and `setImmediate` are part of the `global` object.
- `global` is not part of the V8 engine—it’s one of the extra features provided by Node.js.

### **5. `this` in Node.js**
- In Node.js, `this` is **not equal to the global object**; it refers to an empty object.
- In browsers, objects like `window`, `self`, and `frames` refer to the same global object.
- To standardize, `globalThis` was introduced—it works across all JavaScript runtime environments.

# **Class 4: Node.js Modules**

### **1. Entry Point**
- A Node.js application has **one entry point**, usually `app.js`.
- Other files (e.g., `xyz.js`) are called **modules**.

### **2. Module System**
- Modules are isolated—they protect their variables and functions from leaking.
- To use variables/functions from one module in another, you must **explicitly export** them.

### **3. Importing and Exporting**
- Use `require()` to import a module.
- Whatever is exported using `module.exports` is returned by `require()`.

#### **Exporting Single Values**
```javascript
module.exports = calculateSum;   // OR
module.exports = { calculateSum };
```

#### **Importing Single Values**
```javascript
const calculateSum = require("./sum.js");
```

#### **Exporting Multiple Values**
```javascript
module.exports = { x, calculateSum };  // Using shorthand
```

#### **Importing Multiple Values**
```javascript
const { x, calculateSum } = require("./sum.js");
```

### **4. Types of Modules**
1. **CommonJS Modules (CJS)**  
   - Default in Node.js.  
   - Uses `module.exports` and `require()`.  
   - Synchronous.  
   - Allows non-strict mode.  

2. **ES Modules (ESM)**  
   - Default in React/Angular.  
   - Uses `import` and `export` statements.  
   - Asynchronous.  
   - Always in strict mode.  

### **5. Best Practices**
- Create a single entry point (e.g., `index.js`) to group and export multiple modules for better folder structure.

# **Class 5: Node.js Module Execution**

### **1. Wrapping Code in IIFE**
- Node.js wraps every module in an **Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE)**:
  ```javascript
  (function (exports, require, module, __filename, __dirname) {
    // Module code here
  });
  ```
- **Why?**
  - **Isolation**: Keeps variables and functions private.  
  - **Immediate Execution**: Runs code as soon as it's loaded.

### **2. `require()` Function**
- **5-Step Mechanism**:
  1. **Resolve the Module**  
     Determines the type of module (local file, JSON, or Node internal module).  
  2. **Load the Module**  
     Loads content based on the file type.  
  3. **Wrap the Code**  
     Wraps the module in an IIFE for isolation.  
  4. **Evaluate the Code**  
     Executes the module and returns `module.exports`.  
  5. **Cache the Module**  
     - Once loaded, the module is cached.  
     - If required again, the cached version is returned, skipping the previous steps.

### **3. Benefits of IIFE**
- Prevents variable/function interference.  
- Allows variable reuse across modules.  
- Keeps exported data safe for sharing between modules.

# **Class 6: Node.js Event-Driven Architecture**

### **1. Asynchronous I/O**
- Node.js uses an **event-driven architecture** for non-blocking operations.  
- It can handle multiple I/O operations concurrently, making it highly efficient.  

### **2. JavaScript Nature**
- JavaScript is **single-threaded** and **synchronous** by nature.
- Node.js achieves asynchrony through its **libuv library**, which provides:
  - **Event loop**: Handles asynchronous operations.  
  - **Multithreading**: For certain tasks like file I/O, DNS, and network operations.

---

### **Additional Clarifications**
- **libuv Library**  
  - Powers Node.js's event loop and async I/O operations.  
  - One of the key features that make Node.js scalable and efficient.  

- **Global vs. Module Scope**
  - The `global` object in Node.js contains built-in methods and variables.  
  - Variables declared in a module are private unless exported via `module.exports`.
